Boost Minecraft 1.18.X performance on your PC with [SegwitOptimizer](https://github.com/minecraftbooster/SegwitOptimizer)!

Optimize the use of RAM and CPU resources by clearing RAM when it overflows, and load all CPU cores more equally.

Main features introduced into Minecraft gameplay:

1. All falling EXP is stored in a single drop of EXP, which immediately hit player.
2. When cutting a tree, leaves disappear much faster and don't degrade the graphics.
3. Changed rendering of mobs, buildings, particles.
4. From mod [Better Fps - Render Distance](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-fps-render-distance) borrowed function HRdistStretch.
5. Light renderer has been updated. Now the game scans area and if the object is out of your field of view, it does not receive lighting. It doesn't affect the graphics in any way.

Also optional you can turn on/off third-party mods to boost FPS. The most popular of them do not conflict with SegwitOptimizer.

For example: [Phosphor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/phosphor), [Chunk-Pregenerator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunkpregenerator), [AI Improvements](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ai-improvements)

P.S. ```The Segwit name has no relationship to Segregated Witness. I just liked this word :)```
